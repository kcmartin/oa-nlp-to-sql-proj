Project for OpenAI + Python course: NLP to SQL

This is project 1 for the OpenAI + Python course

Here's a link to a question I had about the project:

https://www.udemy.com/course/openai-python-api-bootcamp-learn-to-use-ai-gpt3-and-more/learn/lecture/36212884#questions/19379022

I tried experimenting with the prompt, and if you use: "return the Sum of SALES per POSTALCODE"
then the correct SQL query is returned by the OpenAI call.
